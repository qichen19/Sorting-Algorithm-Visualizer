## Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This interactive web app was built using React and is used to visualize classic sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, quick sort, heap sort, etc.

This app has been deployed with Netlify and can be accessible under https://unruffled-einstein-8814df.netlify.app/. I hope you have fun playing around with it as much as I do.


## Incentives

I'm always fascinated by all different kinds of sorting algorithms. Making them alive and seeing them in action through this project is a great satisfaction to me. Not to mention I also learn some valuable REACT front end skills along the way.
